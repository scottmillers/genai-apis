# Flux Prompts

## Guidance
LUX excels at producing highly detailed, photorealistic images, particularly when it comes to human subjects, environments, and complex scenes. When creating prompts for FLUX, consider these tips:

- Use descriptive, natural language

- Experiment with different artistic styles and compositions


## Examples

A elegant female ballet dancer in a white tutu and pointe shoes, performing an arabesque pose in a grand theater. Her hair is in a perfect bun, and her makeup is stage-ready. She’s gracefully holding a delicate, swan-shaped card with “/u/PirouettePrincess” written in flowing script. The rich red velvet curtains and ornate gold decorations of the theater create a luxurious backdrop.
